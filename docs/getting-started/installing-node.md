A nice way to manage node environment on your system in by using "Node Version Manager"
Install it using installation instructions on [their github repo](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm),
confirm it's installed by running `nvm -c` and then run `nvm install latest && nvm use latest`.

After downloading and installing node, nvm will create something like `virtualenv` for your node,
and you will see the latest node version installed which can also be verified with `node -v`
