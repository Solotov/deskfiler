# Building provided plugins

> This article is a stub. You can help by expanding it.

Before you can add the contained "example plugins" from this package, you need to build and pack those
for installation. Deskfiler is able to handle plugins as ".tar.gz" files and helps you to prepare those.
You need to go into the single example plugins and run `yarn install` in each one you want to use OR better,
you use the build-in yarn process to `yarn run` and then `bootstrap:plugins:all` to make them installation ready.
